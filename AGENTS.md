## Saved Agency project context

At the start of development work, read `.agency/project.json` and `.agency/MEMORY.md`. If enabled, read only the saved profile relevant to the current task from `.agency/profiles/`. Treat profiles as specialist reference guidance subject to these project instructions and the user's current request. Reuse the saved selection; do not repeat onboarding unless asked. Keep durable decisions and the next step in `.agency/MEMORY.md`; never store secrets. If disabled, skip Agency setup.

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
